# Bank query UI
UI for an application that creates a slack like search scheme.

*NOTE:* You will need to allow mixed-content for this to work. Just search for how to do it on your browser.

# Setup
- clone the repo.
- You will need [`create-elm-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-elm-app)
- This project depends on [bank-query-es](https://github.com/jckdrpr/bank-query-es).
There is a hosted version of that project on aws `http://haskell-es-example.sherubthakur.com/search`
if you can leverage that awesome (I can take that down anytime!) otherwise you will need to
setup the bank-query-es project.
- To start `elm-app start`
